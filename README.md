 The game challenges the player to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The player receives feedback after each guess, helping them to adjust their next guess. The goal is to guess the correct number in the fewest attempts possible.
1. Random Number Generation: The program randomly selects a number within a defined range (e.g., 1-100).
2. Difficulty Levels: Offers different difficulty modes, such as "easy" with more attempts and "hard" with fewer attempts.
3. Hint System: Provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high or too low.
4. Limited Attempts: Players have a fixed number of attempts based on the difficulty level chosen.
5. Replay Option: Allows players to start a new game after finishing the current one.
